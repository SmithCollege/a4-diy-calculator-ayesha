Reflection on your experience with this assignment:

This assignment was a bit challenging for me. The postfix.java part was straightforward to understand. However, I struggled with the infix portion. I spent a long time trying to understand how infix and postfix expressions differ and how to approach them.
I wasnâ€™t quite sure how to get started with infix, but I did my best to figure it out. One part that confused me, in particular, was handling the exponent operator in infix expressions. That took some extra time to understand, but I tried to work around it.
To help myself, I read the Wikipedia page on postfix notation, and that helped me understand the concept more clearly.


This assignment does lend itself to more visual prototyping, so please feel free to go this route. Are you including slides, pseudocode, comments, or something else?
